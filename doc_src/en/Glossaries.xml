  <para>Glossaries are files created and updated manually for use in
  <application>OmegaT</application>.</para>

  <para>If an <application>OmegaT</application> project contains one or more
  glossaries, any terms in the glossary which are also found in the current
  segment will be automatically displayed in the Glossary viewer.</para>

  <para>You define its location and name in the project properties dialog. The
  extension must be <filename>.txt</filename> (if not, it will be added). The
  location of the file must be within the <filename>/glossary
  </filename> folder, but it can be in a deeper directory (e.g.,
  <filename>glossary/sub/glossary.txt</filename>). The file does not need to
  exist when setting it, it will be created (if necessary) when adding a
  glossary entry. If the file already exists, no attempt is done to verify
  the format or the character set of the file: the new entries will always be
  in tab-separated format and UTF-8. As the existing content will not be
  touched, damaged to an existing file would be limited.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>To use an existing glossary, simply place it in the<indexterm
        class="singular">
        <primary>Project files</primary>

        <secondary>Glossary subfolder</secondary>
      </indexterm> <filename>/glossary</filename> folder after creating the
    project. <application>OmegaT</application> automatically detects glossary
    files in this folder when a project is opened. Terms in the current
    segment which <application>OmegaT</application> finds in the glossary
    file(s) are displayed in the Glossary pane:</para>

    <indexterm class="singular">
      <primary>Glossary pane</primary>
    </indexterm>

    </figure>

    <para>The word before the = sign is the source term, and its translation
    is (or are) the words after =. The vocabulary entry can have a comment
    added (see "transitive verb" for the second item). The glossary function
    only finds exact matches with the glossary entry (e.g. does not find
    inflected forms etc.). New terms can be added manually to the glossary
    file(s) during translation (for example in a text editor), but newly added
    terms will not be recognized until the project is reloaded.</para>

    <para>The source term does not have to be a single-word item, as the next
    example shows:</para>

    </figure>

    <para>The underlined item "pop-up menu" can be found in the glossary pane
    as "pojavni menu". Highlighting it in the Glossary pane and then
    rightclicking insets at the cursor position in the target
    segment.<footnote>
        <para>Note that in the above case, this is just half (or even less) of
        the story, as the target language (Slovenian) uses declension. So the
        inserted "pojavni meni" has to be changed to "pojavcnem meniju". In
        other words, typing the term correctly without bothering with
        highlighting and rightclicking is probably faster.</para>

    <para>Glossary files are simple plain text files containing three-column,
    tab-delimited lists with the source and target terms in the first and
    second columns respectively. The third column can be used for additional
    information. Glossary files can be either in system default encoding (and
    indicated by the extension .tab) or in UTF-8 (the extension .utf8). The
    Unicode encoding (UTF8) is preferred for obvious reasons.</para>

    <para>Also supported is the CSV format. This format is the same as the tab
    separated one: source term, target term. Comment fields are separated by a
    comma ','. Strings can be enclosed by quotes ", which allows having a
    comma inside a string:</para>

    <para><literal>"This is a source term, which contains a comma","c'est un
    terme, qui contient une virgule" </literal></para>

    <para>In addition to the plain text format, TBX format <indexterm
        class="singular">
        <primary>Glossaries</primary>

        <secondary>TBX format</secondary>
      </indexterm> is also supported. TBX - Term Base eXchange - is the open,
    XML-based standard for exchanging structured terminological data, TBX has
    been approved as an international standard by LISA<indexterm
        class="singular">
        <primary>LISA -</primary>

        <secondary>File format</secondary>
      </indexterm> and ISO. If you have an existing terminology handling
    system - MultiTerm for example - it is quite possible it offers the export
    of terminology data via TBX format. <ulink

    <title>How to create glossaries<indexterm class="singular">
        <primary>Glossaries</primary>

        <secondary>Creating a glossary</secondary>
      </indexterm></title>

    <para>The project setting allows one can enter a name for a writeable
    glossary file (see beginning of this chapter). Adding new entries is done
    by using the keyboard shortcut <keycap>Ctrl+Shift+G</keycap>. A dialog
    opens, allowing you to enter the source term, target term and any comments
    you may have:</para>

    <mediaobject role="html">
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/GlossaryEntry_25.png"/>
        </imageobject>

        <imageobject role="fo">
          <imagedata fileref="images/GlossaryEntry_25.png" width="80%"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

    <para>The contents of glossary files are kept in memory and are loaded
    when the project is opened or reloaded. Updating a glossary file is thus
    rather simple: press <keycap>Ctrl+Shift+G</keycap> and enter the new
    term, its translation and any comments you may have (ensuring you press
    tab between the fields) and save the file. The contents of the glossary
    pane will be updated accordingly</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Note: </emphasis>Of course there are other
    ways and means to create a simple file with tab delimited entries, and
    they are all simpler, a lot of them much simpler, than the above
    suggestion. For instance, one can export the contents above as a
    <filename>CSV</filename>, instead of a <filename>UTF8</filename> text
    file. Nothing speaks against using Notepad++ on Windows or GEdit on Linux
    for instance: any text editor, that can handle UTF8 and that can show
    white space (so that you do not miss the required <keycap>TAB</keycap>
    characters) can be used.</para>

    <para>Data exported from Trados MultiTerm can be used as
    <application>OmegaT</application> glossaries without further modification,
    provided they are given the file extension <filename>.tab</filename> and
    the source and target term fields are the first two fields respectively.If
    you export using the system option "Tab-delimited export", you will need
    to delete the first 5 columns (Seq. Nr, Date created etc). The newer
    versions of MultiTerm support exporting to TBX format.</para>
