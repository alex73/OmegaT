  <para>Glossaries are files created and updated manually for use in
  <application>OmegaT</application>.</para>

  <para>If an <application>OmegaT</application> project contains one or more
  glossaries, any terms in the glossary which are also found in the current
  segment will be automatically displayed in the Glossary viewer.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>To use an existing glossary, simply place it in the<indexterm
        class="singular">
        <primary>Project files</primary>

        <secondary>Glossary subfolder</secondary>
      </indexterm> <filename>/glossary</filename> folder after creating the
    project. <application>OmegaT</application> automatically detects glossary
    files in this folder when a project is opened. Terms in the current
    segment which <application>OmegaT</application> finds in the glossary
    file(s) are displayed in the Glossary pane:</para>

    <indexterm class="singular">
      <primary>Glossary pane</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The word before the = sign is the source term, and its translation
    is (or are) the words after =. The vocabulary entry can have a comment
    added (see "transitive verb" for the second item). The glossary function
    only finds exact matches with the glossary entry (e.g. does not find
    inflected forms etc.). New terms can be added manually to the glossary
    file(s) during translation (for example in a text editor), but newly added
    terms will not be recognized until the project is reloaded.</para>

    <para>The source term does not have to be a single-word item, as the next
    example shows:</para>

    <para>The underlined item "pop-up menu" can be found in the glossary pane
    as "pojavni menu". Highlighting it in the Glossary pane and then
    rightclicking insets at the cursor position in the target
    segment.<footnote>
        <para>Note that in the above case, this is just half (or even less) of
        the story, as the target language (Slovenian) uses declension. So the
        inserted "pojavni meni" has to be changed to "pojavcnem meniju". In
        other words, tzping the term correctly without bothering with
        highlighting and rightclicking is probably faster. </para>

    <para>Glossary files are simple plain text files containing three-column,
    tab-delimited lists with the source and target terms in the first and
    second columns respectively. The third column can be used for additional
    information. Glossary files can be either in system default encoding (and
    indicated by the extension .tab) or in UTF-8 (the extension .utf8). The
    Unicode encoding (UTF8) is preferred for obvious reasons.</para>

    <para>Also supported is the CSV format. This format is the same as the tab
    separated one: source term, target term. Comment fields are separated by a
    comma ','. Strings can be enclosed by quotes ", which allows having a
    comma inside a string:</para>

    <para><literal>"This is a source term, which contains a comma","c'est un
    terme, qui contient une virgule" </literal></para>

    <para>In addition to the plain text format, TBX format <indexterm
        class="singular">
        <primary>Glossaries</primary>

        <secondary>TBX format</secondary>
      </indexterm> is also supported. TBX - Term Base eXchange - is the open,
    XML-based standard for exchanging structured terminological data, TBX has
    been approved as an international standard by LISA<indexterm
        class="singular">
        <primary>LISA -</primary>

        <secondary>File format</secondary>
      </indexterm> and ISO. If you have an existing terminology handling
    system - MultiTerm for example - it is quite possible it offers the export
    of terminology data via TBX format. <ulink

        <secondary>Creating a glossary</secondary>
      </indexterm></title>

    <para>The method here is foolproof, when followed in a reasonably careful
    fashion. You need OpenOffice.org Writer for it, so - if you haven't
    already done so - download and install OpenOffice.org. Launch
    OpenOffice.org and open a new text document or launch "OpenOffice.org
    Writer".</para>

    <para>In the empty document, enter your glossary terms as follows: a
    source-language term, tab space, the target-language term , tab space, a
    comment or explanation for the item, and a Return. Tab space is the
    tabulator key on the left hand side of the keyboard. If you do not wish to
    add any comments, you can drop the second tab space. A "term" can be a
    single word or a whole phrase. On the second line, enter the second term
    and its translation.</para>

    <para>When you have finished entering the terms, you will have two
    "columns" of terms, source-language terms on the left and their
    target-language terms on the right, and possibly a third column,
    containing you comments and explanations, The tab space (→ in the example
    below) and Enter (¶) characters can be made visible by clicking on the ¶
    icon in the Writer's Standard writer bar. Here are a few lines of an
    English -German glossary)</para>

    <para><literal>word →Wort→das (-/e/s, Wörter/-e)¶</literal></para>

    <para><literal>small house→Häuschen→das, (pl Häuschen)¶</literal></para>

    <para><literal>dog →Hund→m, f Hündin ¶</literal></para>

    <para><literal>horse→Pferd→n, m Hengst f Stute n Fohlen¶</literal></para>

    <para>Do NOT use OpenOffice.org's "columns" function to create columns:
    just separate each source and target-language term pair with a single tab
    space.</para>

    <para>When you are finished with the entries, save the file as
    Unicode-encoded file as follows:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select <literal>File &gt; Save As</literal></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

        for your glossary file.</para>

        and <emphasis>"Edit filter settings"</emphasis> are unchecked.</para>

    <para>Confirm with OK.</para>

    <para>After creating an OmegaT project, copy or move this file into the
    project's \glossary folder. If the project is already open, reload it
    after copying the glossary file into the project. You can make changes to
    a glossary file while it is being used in a project. Glossary changes are
    detected approximately once every second and modifications load
    transparently in the background, so there's no need to reload the project
    after saving the new glossary file.</para>

    <para>When a segment containing a source-text term is opened, the glossary
    pane will display glossary entries for those items in the source segment
    that can be found in the glossary (or glossaries - you can have more than
    one available, and they can be stored in subfolders of <emphasis>glossary
    </emphasis>as well).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Note: </emphasis>Of course there are other
    ways and means to create a simple file with tab delimited entries, and
    they are all simpler, a lot of them much simpler, than the above
    suggestion. For instance, one can export the contents above as a
    <filename>CSV</filename>, instead of a <filename>UTF8</filename> text
    file. Note, however, that the above suggestion works for any target
    system, be it Windows, OS X or Linux. Nothing speaks against using
    Notepad++ on Windows or GEdit on Linux for instance: any text editor, that
    can handle UTF8 and that can show white space (so that you do not miss the
    required <keycap>TAB</keycap> characters) can be used.</para>

    <para>The contents of glossary files are kept in memory and are loaded
    when the project is opened or reloaded. Updating a glossary file is thus
    rather simple:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When you come across a new term that you would like to add to
        your glossary, enter the new term, its translation and any comments
        you may have (ensuring you press tab between the fields) and save the
        file. The contents of the glossary pane will be updated
        accordingly.</para>

    respectively.</para>

    <para>If you export using the system option "Tab-delimited export", you
    will need to delete the first 5 columns (Seq. Nr, Date created etc). The
    newer versions of MultiTerm support exporting to TBX format.</para>
