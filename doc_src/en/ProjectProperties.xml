    <para>All the fields are editable. You can either enter the languages by

          </indexterm></emphasis></para>

        <para>Bear in mind that changing the languages may render the
        currently used translation memories useless since their language pair
        may not longer match the new languages.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Segmentation modifications:<indexterm

            <secondary>Modifying segmentation</secondary>
          </indexterm></emphasis></para>

        <para>The segmentation settings only address the way the source files
        are handled by <application>OmegaT</application>. They do not modify
        the segmentation of already existing translation memories.</para>

        <para>Changes made to the segmentation settings may cause some already
        translated segments to be split or merged. This will effectively
        return them to the "untranslated" status, as they will no longer match
        segments recorded in the project memory, even though their original
        translation is still there.</para>

        <para>OmegaT may upgrade old translation memories that did not use
        sentence segmentation, but not vice versa. If you decide
        mid-translation to switch from sentence to paragraph translation, the
        internal translation memory of the project will not be changed.</para>

        <para>In case you decide to modify project folders, keep in mind that
        this will not move the contained files from old folders to the new
        location.</para>

          </indexterm></emphasis></para>

        <para>It is possible to modify the project properties during a
        translation session. However, until you have some experience with
        OmegaT, it is safest to consider all settings final once the
        translation has started â€“ unless of course you realize a major mistake
        has been made. See the section Preventing data loss for ways and means
        of protecting your work.</para>
