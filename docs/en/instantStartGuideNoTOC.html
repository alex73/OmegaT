            <p><em><span class="remark">Note:</span></em>On an Apple Mac, use the <span class="keycap"><strong>Cmd</strong></span>

               key
            </p>
            <p>To start using OmegaT, first create a project that will hold all
               your files, such as your source file, translation memories, glossaries,
               and eventually your translated file. In the <span class="guimenu">Project</span>
               menu, select <span class="guimenu"></span> â†’ <span class="guimenuitem">New...</span><a class="indexterm" name="d0e34"></a> type a name for your project. Remember where you create the
               project, because you will later need to return to it.
            </p>
            <p>After you give your project a name, the Create New Project dialog
               will open. At the top of that dialog, select your source file's language
               and the language that your translated file will be, and click
               <span class="guibutton">OK </span>to continue
            </p>
            <p><span class="application">If you are interested in other settings of this dialog,
                  you can return to it any time by pressing
                  <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl+E.</strong></span></span></p>
            <p>Next, the Project Files dialog opens. Click the Import source
               files... to select your source file. OmegaT will then copy the selected
               file to the <code class="filename">/source/</code>subfolder of your newly created
               project. After the source file has loaded in the Editor pane, you can
               close the Project files dialog.

            <p>OmegaT will present one segment at a time for you to translate.
               After you have translated each segment, press <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl+U </strong></span>to
               move to the next untranslated segment. Whenever you want to see what your
               translation will look like in its final format, press
               <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl+D</strong></span> to generate the translated document, which will be
               created in the /target/ subfolder of your project folder. During
               translation, use the <span class="guimenu">Edit</span> and <span class="guimenu">Go To</span>
               menus to perform various useful functions..

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>If your source file is a formatted file, e.g. Microsoft Word,
               LibreOffice Writer or HTML, OmegaT will convert the formatting into tags
               that surround the text that you translate. Often documents will also have
               tags that have nothing to do with formatting, but which are also
               important.In the source file (and in the translated file), A source
               sentence might look like
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="mediaobject" align="left"><img src="images/InstantGuide_1.png" align="left"></div>
            <p></p>
            <p>OmegaT, however, will present this sentence in the following
               fashion:
            </p>
            <p><code class="literal"></code></p>
            <div class="mediaobject" align="left"><img src="images/InstantGuide_2.png" align="left"></div>
            <p></p>
            <p>The tags in OmegaT are greyed, so they are easy to recognise. They
               are not protected, so that you can delete them, enter them by hand or move
               them around in the target sentence. However, if you made mistakes when you
               typed the formatting tags, your translated file might fail to open.
               Therefore, press <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl+T</strong></span> before you generate your
               translated file, to validate that your tags are correct.
