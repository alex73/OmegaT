                        <p>The /tm/ folder can contain any number of ancillary

                                       in any of the three varieties indicated above. Note that other CAT

                                       three forms. The best thing of course is to use OmegaT-specific
                                       TMX files (see above), so that the in-line formatting within the
                                       segment is retained.
                        </p>
                        <p>The contents of translation memories in the tm subfolder
                                       serve to generate suggestions for the text(s) to be translated.
                                       Any text, already translated and stored in those files, will
                                       appear among the fuzzy matches, if it is sufficiently similar to
                                       the text currently being translated.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the source segment in one of the ancillary TMs is
                                       identical to the text being translated, OmegaT acts as defined in
                                       the <span class="guimenu">Options</span> â†’ <span class="guimenuitem">Editing Behavior...</span> dialogue window. For instance (if the default is
                                       accepted), the translation from the ancillary TM is accepted and
                                       prefixed with<span class="emphasis"><em> [fuzzy]</em></span>, so that the translator
                                       can review the translations at a later stage and check whether the
                                       segments tagged this way, have been translated correctly (see the

               <p>Optionally, you can let <span class="application">OmegaT</span> have an

               </p>
               <p>Note that all the translation memories are loaded into memory when
                        the project is opened. Back-ups are produced regularly of the project
                        translation memory (see next chapter), and
                        <code class="filename">project_save.tmx</code> is also saved/updated when the
                        project is closed or loaded again. This means for instance that you do
                        not need to exit a project you are currently working on if you decide to
                        add another ancillary TM to it: you simply reload the project, and the
                        changes you have made will be included.
               </p>
               <p>The locations of the various different translation memories for a
                        given project are user-defined (see Project dialog window in <a class="link" href="chapter.instant.start.guide.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Learn to use OmegaT in 5 minutes!">Instant start guide)</a></p>
               <p>Depending on the situation, different strategies are thus

                        that you segments from order1, that are not present in order2 and other

               <p>tmx files contain translation units, made of a number of
                        equivalent segments in several languages. A translation unit comprises
                        at least two translation unit variations (TUV). Either can be used as
                        the source or target.

               <p>The settings in your project indicate which is the source and
                        which the target language. OmegaT thus takes the TUV segments
                        corresponding to the project's source and target language codes and uses
                        them as the source and target segments respectively. OmegaT recognizes
                        the language codes using the following two standard conventions :

               <p>If the project language codes and the tmx language codes fully
                        match, the segments are loaded in memory. If languages match but not the
                        country, the segments still get loaded. If neither the language code not
                        the country code match, the segments will be ignored.
               </p>
               <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6099"></a>TMX files can generally contain translation units with
                        several candidate languages. If for a given source segment there is no
                        entry for the selected target language, all other target segments are
                        loaded, regardless of the language. This avoids loading unwanted
                        non-project languages from multilingual TMXs, while still allowing the
                        use of monolingual TMXs with other target languages than the project
                        target language selected. For instance if the language pair of the
                        project is DE-FR, it can be still be of some help to have access to a
                        DE-EN translation, if there's no match in the DE-FR pair.

            <p>Initially, that is when the project is created, the main TM of the
                   project, <code class="filename">project_save.tmx</code> is empty. This TM gradually
                   becomes filled during the translation. To speed up this process, existing
                   translations can be reused. If a given sentence has already been
                   translated once, and translated correctly, there is no need for it to be
                   retranslated. Translation memories may also contain reference
                   translations: multinational legislation, such as that of the European
                   Community, is a typical example.
            </p>
            <p>When you create the target documents in an
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> project, the translation memory of the
                   project is outputted in the form of three files in the root folder of your
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> project (see the above description). You
                   can regard these three tmx files (<code class="filename">-omegat.tmx</code>,
                   <code class="filename">-level1.tmx</code> and <code class="filename">-level2.tmx</code>) as
                   an "export translation memory", i.e. as an export of your current
                   project's content in bilingual form.
            </p>
            <p>Should you wish to reuse a translation memory from a previous
                   project (for example because the new project is similar to the previous
                   project, or uses terminology which might have been used before), you can
                   use these translation memories as "input translation memories", i.e. for
                   import into your new project. In this case, place the translation memories
                   you wish to use in the <span class="emphasis"><em>\tm</em></span> or
                   <span class="emphasis"><em>\tm</em></span>\auto folder of your new project: in the former
                   case you will get hits from these translation memories in the fuzzy
                   matches viewer, and in the latter case these TMs will be used to
                   pre-translate your source text.
            </p>
            <p>By default, the \tm folder is below the project's root folder (e.g.
                   ...<span class="emphasis"><em>\MyProject\tm</em></span>), but you can choose a different
                   folder in the project properties dialog if you wish. This is useful if you
                   frequently use translation memories produced in the past, for example
                   because they are on the same subject or for the same customer. In this
                   case, a useful procedure would be:

                        to be read by OmegaT. However, OmegaT does not fully support imported
                        level 2 tmx files (these store not only the translation, but also the
                        formatting). Level 2 tmx files will still be imported and their textual
                        content can be seen in OmegaT, but the quality of fuzzy matches will be

               <p>OmegaT follows very strict procedures when loading translation
                        memory (tmx) files. If an error is found in such a file, OmegaT will
                        indicate the position within the defective file at which the error is
                        located.

               <p>Some tools are known to produce invalid tmx files under certain
                        conditions. If you wish to use such files as reference translations in
                        OmegaT, they must be repaired, or OmegaT will report an error and fail
                        to load them. Fixes are trivial operations and OmegaT assists
                        troubleshooting with the related error message. You can ask the user
                        group for advice if you have problems.

            <p>The tmx file can be given any name you specify. A pseudo-translated
                   memory can be generated with the following command line parameters:
            </p>
            <p><code class="literal">java -jar omegat.jar --pseudotranslatetmx=&lt;filename&gt;
                      [pseudotranslatetype=[equal|empty]]</code></p>
            <p>Replace <code class="literal">&lt;filename&gt;</code> with the name of the
                   file you wish to create, either absolute or relative to the working
                   directory (the directory you start <span class="application">OmegaT</span>
                   from). The second argument <code class="literal">--pseudotranslatetype</code> is
                   optional. Its value is either <code class="literal">equal</code> (default value, for
                   source=target) or <code class="literal">empty</code> (target segment is empty). You
                   can process the generated tmx with any tool you want. To reuse it in
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> rename it to <span class="emphasis"><em>project_save.tmx
                         </em></span> and place it in the <code class="literal">omegat</code>-folder of your
                   project.

            <p>Very early versions of <span class="application">OmegaT</span> were
                   capable of segmenting source files into paragraphs only and were
                   inconsistent when numbering formatting tags in HTML and Open Document
                   files. <span class="application">OmegaT</span> 2.5 can detect and upgrade such
                   tmx files on the fly to increase fuzzy matching quality and leverage your
                   existing translation better, saving you the work of doing this
                   manually.
            </p>
            <p>A project's tmx will be upgraded only once, and will be written in
                   upgraded form into the <code class="filename">project-save.tmx</code>; legacy tmx
                   files will be upgraded on the fly each time the project is loaded. Note
                   that in some cases changes in file filters in
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> 2.5 may lead to totally different
                   segmentation; as a result, you will have to upgrade your translation
                   manually in such rare cases.
