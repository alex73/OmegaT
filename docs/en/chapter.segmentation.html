         <p>Translation memory tools work with textual units called segments.
              <span class="application">OmegaT</span> has two ways to segment a text: by
              paragraph or by sentence segmentation (also referred to as “rule-based
              segmentation”). In order to select the type of segmentation, select
              <span class="guimenu"><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6422"></a>Project</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Properties...</span> from the main menu and tick or untick the check box
              provided. Paragraph segmentation is advantageous in certain cases, such as
              highly creative or stylistic translations in which the translator may wish
              to change the order of entire sentences; for the majority of projects,
              however, sentence segmentation is a choice to be preferred, since it
              delivers better matches from previous translations. If sentence segmentation
              has been selected, you can setup the rules by selecting <span class="guimenu"><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6433"></a>Options</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Segmentation...</span>from the main menu.
         </p>
         <p>Dependable segmentation rules are already available for many
              languages, so it is likely that you will not need to get involved with
              writing your own segmentation rules. On the other hand this functionality
              can be very useful in special cases, where you can increase your
              productivity by tuning the segmentation rules to the text to be
              translated.
         </p>
         <p><span class="bold"><strong>Warning: </strong></span>because the text will
              segment differently after filter options have been changed, so you may have
              to start translating from scratch. At the same time the previous valid
              segments in the project translation memory will turn into orphan segments.
              If you change segmentation options when a project is open, you must reload
              the project in order for the changes to take effect.
         </p>
         <p><span class="application">OmegaT</span> uses the following sequence of
              steps:
         </p>
         <div class="variablelist">
            <dl>
               <dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6455"></a>Structure level segmentation</span></dt>
               <dd>
                  <p><span class="application">OmegaT</span> first parses the text for
                             structure-level segmentation. During this process it is only the
                             structure of the source file that is used to produce segments.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, text files may be segmented on line breaks, empty
                             lines, or not be segmented at all. Files containing formatting
                             (OpenOffice.org documents, HTML documents, etc.) are segmented on the
                             block-level (paragraph) tags. Translatable object attributes in XHTML
                             or HTML files can be extracted as separate segments.

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>The process of segmenting can be pictured as follows: the cursor
                   moves along the text, one character at a time. At each cursor position
                   rules, consisting of a <span class="bold"><strong>Before </strong></span>and
                   <span class="bold"><strong>After </strong></span>pattern, are applied in their given
                   order to see if any of the<span class="bold"><strong> Before</strong></span>
                   patterns are valid for the text on the left and the corresponding
                   <span class="bold"><strong>After</strong></span> pattern for the text on the right
                   of the cursor. If the rule matches, either the cursor moves on without
                   inserting a segment break (for an exception rule) or a new segment break
                   is created at the current cursor position (for the break rule).
            </p>
            <p>The two types of rules behave as follows:</p>
            <div class="variablelist">
               <dl>
                  <dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6509"></a>Break rule</span></dt>
                  <dd>
                     <p>Separates the source text into segments. For example,
                                  "<span class="emphasis"><em>Did it make sense? I was not sure</em></span>." should be
                                  split into two segments. For this to happen, there should be a break
                                  rule for "?", when followed by spaces and a capitalized word. To
                                  define a rule as a break rule, tick the Break/Exception check
                                  box.
                     </p>
                  </dd>
               </dl>
            </div>
            <div class="variablelist">
               <dl>
                  <dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6526"></a>Exception rule</span></dt>
                  <dd>
                     <p>specify what parts of text should NOT be separated. In spite
                                  of the period, <span class="emphasis"><em>"Mrs. Dalloway "</em></span> should not be
                                  split in two segments, so an exception rule should be established
                                  for Mrs (and for Mr, for Dr, for prof etc), followed by a period. To
                                  define a rule as an exception rule, leave the Break/Exception check
                                  box unticked.
                     </p>
                  </dd>
               </dl>
            </div>
            <p>The predefined break rules should be sufficient for most European
                   languages and Japanese. In view of the flexibility, you may consider
                   defining more exception rules for your source language in order to provide
                   more meaningful and coherent segments.

            <p>All segmentation rule sets for a matching language pattern are
                   active and are applied in the given order of priority, so rules for
                   specific language should be higher than default ones. For example, rules
                   for Canadian French (FR-CA) should be set higher than rules for French
                   (FR.*), and higher than Default (.*) ones. Thus, when translating from
                   Canadian French the rules for Canadian French - if any - will be applied
                   first, followed by the rules for French and lastly, by the Default
                   rules.

            <p>Major changes to the segmentation rules should be generally avoided,
                   especially after completion of the first draft, but minor changes, such as
                   the addition of a recognized abbreviation, can be advantageous.
            </p>
            <p>In order to edit or expand an existing set of rules, simply click on
                   it in the top table. The rules for that set will appear in the bottom half
                   of the window.
            </p>
            <p>In order to create an empty set of rules for a new language pattern
                   click <span class="bold"><strong>Add </strong></span>in the upper half of the
                   dialog. An empty line will appear at the bottom of the upper table (you
                   may have to scroll down to see it). Change the name of the rule set and
                   the language pattern to the language concerned and its code (see <a class="xref" href="appendix.languages.html" title="Appendix&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Languages - ISO 639 code list">Appendix&nbsp;B, <i>Languages - ISO 639 code list
                       
                       
                       
                       </i></a> for a list of language codes).
                   The syntax of the language pattern conforms to regular expression syntax.
                   If your set of rules handles a language-country pair, we advise you to
                   move it to the top using the <span class="bold"><strong>Move Up</strong></span>
                   button.
            </p>
            <p>Add the <span class="bold"><strong>Before</strong></span> and<span class="bold"><strong> After</strong></span> patterns. To check their syntax and their
                   applicability, it is advisable to use tools which allow you to see their
                   effect directly. See the chapter on <a class="link" href="chapter.regexp.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;15.&nbsp;Regular expressions">Regular
                      expressions</a>. A good starting point will always be the existing
